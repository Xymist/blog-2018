Shortly after I left university, I decided that given my general misanthropy and preference for being alone,
I'd be well served by buying myself somewhere sensible to live. Time passed and, as such things do, the plan
got overridden by realities of life. That was 2014.

Three years and two jobs later, I found myself a little place in a new conversion in the south of Bristol. It
looked great; good size, shiny new fittings, convenient location. Unfortunately there are dozens of reasons
a house purchase might fall through, and a couple of them happened to come up. Rising damp, a leaking roof,
poor management and some rather disconcerting details about the company doing the conversion lead to me
needing to pull out before anything was signed.

There followed a couple of months of spinning wheels while I sought something else that seemed worthwhile. Sad to
say, the market for reasonably priced detached homes for single people in South East England is a bit slim,
so a flat it would have to be. I don't particularly like having neighbours, but since I don't yet possess the
resources necessary to purchase large quantities of land just so that nobody else can live within my horizon
I have resolved to take the cheaper option of spending the majority of my time indoors. That does, however, mean
that I need enough floor space not to go completely insane; about seven hundred square foot, empirically.
