Shortly after I left university, I decided that given my general misanthropy and preference for being alone,
I'd be well served by buying myself somewhere sensible to live. Time passed and, as such things do, the plan
got overridden by realities of life. That was 2014.

Three years and two jobs later, I found myself a little place in a new conversion in the south of Bristol. It
looked great; good size, shiny new fittings, convenient location. Unfortunately there are dozens of reasons
a house purchase might fall through, and a couple of them happened to come up. Rising damp, a leaking roof,
poor management and some rather disconcerting details about the company doing the conversion lead to me
needing to pull out before anything was signed.

There followed a couple of months of spinning wheels while I sought something else that seemed worthwhile.
