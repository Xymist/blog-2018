Actual doing-things-so-someone-pays-me-regularly employment rather than the halfway states of freelancing and contract work which have previously occupied my time. This is a bit of a departure for me, not least because I have an uneasy relationship with the concept of working for anyone other than myself, but it is a remote position and I appear to have a fair bit of leeway in how I structure my work as long as I produce the results requested.Other than a slightly ridiculous requirement that basically all information is kept as a .docx or .xlsx &amp;lsquo;somewhere&amp;rsquo; in the (vast, semistructured) Google Drive storage, anyway. Apparently that&amp;rsquo;s so the people who don&amp;rsquo;t use GitHub and can&amp;rsquo;t read Markdown get a look in, which seems like a very bad plan from start to finish, frankly, but it&amp;rsquo;s not my company so I can&amp;rsquo;t say much.

  "body": "While working on the kiosk project I&amp;rsquo;ve been frustrated with the times when our remote terminals are turned off (usually by a user or a cleaner). We can&amp;rsquo;t set them to wake on LAN because we mostly have to go through firewalls and the wider internet, but it would at least be nice to know when and why I can&amp;rsquo;t connect. If nothing else we can then pick up a phone and tell someone to turn it on rather than running a bunch of fruitless network diagnostics.Nagios is a &amp;lsquo;free&amp;rsquo; (very expensive if you want the full package, but the Core package is good enough for most purposes) piece of software which monitors your servers, switches, routers, terminals and whatever else (basically any item with a MAC or IP address) one needs to keep track of. I decided to try it out on my own servers, and was pleased with the results and the ease of setting it up, so I approached my &amp;lsquo;manager&amp;rsquo; on the project about my taking the time to implement it on the systems we&amp;rsquo;ve been deploying. Fortunately, he could see the benefits and I received approval to pilot it with some of the kiosks.Nagios ships with a configuration for Apache2, but this has two issues as far as I&amp;rsquo;m concerned. First, it expects the web address to be /nagios, which feels inelegant. Second and more fundamentally, I&amp;rsquo;m not an Apache fan; I much prefer Nginx, though for most practical purposes this is purely a personal preference rather than something upon which a great deal of functionality hinges. As such the configuration needed to be altered a little bit to get things running properly. I&amp;rsquo;ve sketched out below how I went about getting all this running; it might prove useful to someone at some point. This is an amalgamation of some information from DigitalOcean, some from a few blogs (one of which included an error that I spent some time hunting down), and my own debugging. I&amp;rsquo;m assuming you&amp;rsquo;re using Ubuntu 16.04 as your base image.Prerequisites:sudo apt-get install nginx libpcre3-dev build-essential libssl-dev php5-cli php5-fpm php5-cgi psmisc spawn-fcgi fcgiwrap libgd2-xpm-dev openssl libssl-dev xinetd apache2-utils unzip We need apache2-utils for htpasswd, which gives us our authentication ability.Set up the users and groups which Nagios expects (these are in a few places in the default config; it&amp;rsquo;s not worth changing them)sudo adduser nagios &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sudo add group nagcmd sudo usermod -a -G nagcmd nagios &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sudo usermod -G nagcmd www-data  Grab the necessary packages (current as of 2016-06-16; do check the latest version number):curl -L -O https://assets.nagios.com/downloads/nagioscore/releases/nagios-4.1.1.tar.gz curl -L -O http://nagios-plugins.org/download/nagios-plugins-2.1.1.tar.gz curl -L -O http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/nagios/nrpe-2.x/nrpe-2.15/nrpe-2.15.tar.gz tar xvf *.tar.gz  You should now have three directories; you can now remove the tarballs if you want to save space.cd nagios-4.1.1Then make and build:./configure --with-nagios-group=nagios --with-command-group=nagcmd make all sudo make install sudo make install-commandmode sudo make install-init sudo make install-config  That should take care of Nagios Core itself.Now we need to do the same for nagios-plugins&amp;hellip;cd ../nagios-plugins-2.1.1 ./configure --with-nagios-user=nagios --with-nagios-group=nagios --with-openssl make make install  &amp;hellip;and then NRPE, which also needs to be installed on all your servers (we&amp;rsquo;ll get to that).cd ../nrpe-2.15 ./configure --enable-command-args --with-nagios-user=nagios --with-nagios-group=nagios --with-ssl=/usr/bin/openssl --with-ssl-lib=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu make all sudo make install sudo make install-xinetd sudo make install-daemon-config  That takes care of the software side, now it&amp;rsquo;s just configuration.You need to allow Nagios to look at itself, so sudo nano /etc/xinetd.d/nrpe and add the IP address of the server you&amp;rsquo;re working on to the line beginning only_from =. Then restart the service with sudo service xinetd restart - you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t see an error.While we&amp;rsquo;re on services, sudo ln -s /etc/init.d/nagios /etc/rcS.d/S99nagios will let the Nagios service restart on a reboot, which is handy because we&amp;rsquo;re super lazy and can&amp;rsquo;t be bothered to start these things manually.We&amp;rsquo;re not using the standard /nagios location, which means we have to change that as well; sudo nano /usr/local/nagios/etc/cgi.cfg and find the line url_html_path=/nagios. Remove the last six characters.Nagios also needs to be able to contact you if there is a problem, and logging in would probably be handy, so let&amp;rsquo;s take care of that.sudo nano /usr/local/nagios/etc/objects/contacts.cfg and where it tells you to set your email address, do that. It&amp;rsquo;s clearly labeled, amazingly.sudo htpasswd -c /usr/local/nagios/etc/htpasswd.users nagiosadmin to create the necessary auth in the correct place.Nginx now needs some love; it doesn&amp;rsquo;t yet know about PHP or fcgiwrap, so sudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf and add these inside the http block:upstream php { server unix:/var/run/php5-fpm.sock; } upstream fcgiwrap { server unix:/var/run/fcgiwrap.socket; }  These should both exist, since we installed php5-fpm and fcgiwrap earlier, but do check with ls /var/run that they&amp;rsquo;re both present. The first one ends &amp;lsquo;.sock&amp;rsquo;, the second ends &amp;lsquo;.socket&amp;rsquo;, because why would anybody ever hope for consistency in such matters?You then need to create the necessary config file, so sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/nagios and insert the following:server { listen 80; server_name nagios.YOURDOMAIN.TLD; access_log /var/log/nginx/nagios.access.log; error_log /var/log/nginx/nagios.error.log info; expires 31d; root /usr/local/nagios/share; index index.php index.html; auth_basic &amp;quot;Nagios Restricted Access&amp;quot;; auth_basic_user_file /usr/local/nagios/etc/htpasswd.users; location ~ \\.cgi$ { root /usr/local/nagios/sbin; rewrite ^/nagios/cgi-bin/(.*)$ /$1; rewrite ^/cgi-bin/(.*)$ /$1; include /etc/nginx/fastcgi_params; fastcgi_param AUTH_USER $remote_user; fastcgi_param REMOTE_USER $remote_user; fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME /usr/local/nagios/sbin/$fastcgi_script_name; fastcgi_pass fcgiwrap; } location ~ \\.php$ { fastcgi_split_path_info ^(.+\\.php)(.*)$; fastcgi_index index.php; fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name; #fastcgi_param PATH_INFO $fastcgi_script_name; include fastcgi_params; fastcgi_pass php; } }  You can then link this to the sites-enabled location with ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/nagios /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/nagios and restart Nginx with sudo service nginx restart.All being well, you should get an OK from the service restart, and browsing to nagios.yourdomain.tld should present you with a login prompt and then the main panel; the only thing in Hosts is Localhost, but that&amp;rsquo;s all right since we didn&amp;rsquo;t create any others.Next time I&amp;rsquo;ll cover adding and linking other hardware, sorting your config files, and custom service monitoring with plugins.",

I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to (the stack of article ideas and &amp;lsquo;TODO:&amp;rsquo; notes keeps growing, which ironically will be the subject of another post) but somehow the time and the will never seemed to coincide. This has mainly come about because I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing some actual useful work, at least some of which has involved some coding, which is always entertaining.It was nearly a year ago that I first started blogging; I&amp;rsquo;ve learned a considerable amount since then (so much so that some of these posts now appear as &amp;lsquo;how not to do it&amp;rsquo;), which I suppose is a good sign. If I didn&amp;rsquo;t read through my old posts and conclude that past!Jamie wasn&amp;rsquo;t very bright, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be progressing very much!I&amp;rsquo;ve been in need of a good low-level (ish) language for some time - my D is poor, my C/C++ nonexistent, and my Java not exactly stellar. The biggest problem has been finding one which I like, and which compares favourably in terms of readability to Ruby, which has been my favourite language (slightly ahead of Python) for quite some time. Haskell, while beautiful and elegant when it&amp;rsquo;s going right, is a complete pain when it&amp;rsquo;s going wrong. Moreover it&amp;rsquo;s not as fast as many other languages, and isn&amp;rsquo;t especially marketable. I&amp;rsquo;ll be keeping at it, though, because it has taught me more about how good code works than any other language.While investigating possibilities to fill this need, I looked at Clojure, Elixir, Swift and C# (for a variety of different reasons), but finally settled on Go. It&amp;rsquo;s still not as heavily syntactically-sugared as I&amp;rsquo;d like, but it&amp;rsquo;s clean, tidy and fast, and compiles across all platforms to nice statically-linked binaries, which some others (Haskell and D, in particular) definitely do not. Attempting to cross-compile Haskell code for Windows on Linux was a nightmare. I&amp;rsquo;m also quite fond of the GOPATH system (directly pulling dependencies from Github if they&amp;rsquo;re not already cached? Yes please!) and the linting/hinting/prettifying tools don&amp;rsquo;t hurt a bit.As a first pass at simplifying things, I&amp;rsquo;ve moved both the site and the blog over to Hugo - previously the site was slightly messy AngularJS while the blog ran on Ghost. I have no issues with Ghost, it&amp;rsquo;s a lovely piece of software, but I was never entirely happy with Angular as a framework. Mostly because I don&amp;rsquo;t like JavaScript very much. This has reduced the amount I needed to write quite considerably, though the theme did need some work, and integrates the blog properly into the website rather than having it as a separate engine.I have also dropped Nginx in favour of Caddy; not because I have anything against Nginx (unlike Apache; I&amp;rsquo;m still using it for my other projects) but because it too is written in Go, it&amp;rsquo;s small and simple to configure, and I wanted to test out some of its more cutting edge features, in particular the auto-SSL function which leverages LetsEncrypt&amp;rsquo;s handy API to acquire a valid certificate on first startup. That went perfectly, so gone are the days of anyone having the slightest excuse for a self-signed (or absent!) certificate. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen a slight reduction in server resource usage into the bargain, which while almost irrelevant on a site this size bodes well for scalability.In case anyone is interested, the difference between setting up Nginx and setting up Caddy is this:Nginx (After having created, concatenated and installed an SSL certificate from elsewhere)server { listen 80 default_server; server_name yourdomain.com www.yourdomain.com; return 301 https://$server_name$request_uri; } #This redirects all insecure traffic via https. server { listen 443; ssl on; ssl_certificate /etc/ssl/certs/yourdomain.crt; ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/private/yourdomain.key; root /var/www/yoursitename/public_html/; index index.html index.htm; server_name yourdomain.com www.yourdomain.com; location / { try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html; } }  Caddy (Without doing much of anything else apart from importing Caddy and the Hugo site)https://jamieduerden.co.uk { gzip root public basicauth /admin #USER# #PASS# hugo }  Why reinvent what someone else has so beautifully wrought, hm?I&amp;rsquo;ve taken the opportunity to update many of my old blog posts, reducing typos and so on, and to expand greatly my Projects section. That&amp;rsquo;s somewhere between vanity and marketing, I think.Mucking around with websites aside, I do feel as if I have been slacking in my day to day life enrichment. Not enough shooting, cooking, or anything much else other than working. Good for my CV, not so good for my soul (metaphorically speaking; we don&amp;rsquo;t actually have those). I&amp;rsquo;ll be attempting to address this problem, and writing up the results here. It&amp;rsquo;s sort of a two birds, one stone approach.",

Move my site (and blog) over to the new server Write a blog post explaining these steps so that I can refer back to it when I need to do this ridiculously protracted process again.  This is the final step. This may prove useful to some of you, someday, under a somewhat unlikely set of circumstances. I won&amp;rsquo;t be covering what to do if you use Windows, other than to say that for the first steps you&amp;rsquo;ll need PuTTY for the connections, and PuTTYgen to create your SSH key.I bear no responsibility for any damage caused to your sanity or computer systems if you attempt to use this information.Prep WorkFirst thing to do is create an SSH key, since that&amp;rsquo;s much more convenient than passwords.If you&amp;rsquo;re running Linux you should already have ssh-keygen, and if not you can install it with sudo apt-get ssh-keygen, which you then use with ssh-keygen -b 4096 and follow the instructions. Leave the path as the default, supply a nice strong passphrase, and make sure it creates the files id_rsa and id_rsa.pub in your .ssh folder. You can use ls /home/yourname/.ssh to check.Now you need a web address. You can buy this from wherever you like, I used Namecheap. Once it exists you can ignore it for the moment; we&amp;rsquo;ll point it somewhere useful later.Then you need an SSL key. You could do this after you start up the server, but StartSSL will sort out some of it for you, which LetsEncrypt doesn&amp;rsquo;t yet. They&amp;rsquo;re working on better automation, but it&amp;rsquo;s not quite there. Over at StartSSL, register for an account, verify your identity, and ask for a certificate for your domain. You also get one subdomain - I used blog., fairly often people get mail. or www.. Fit to your own requirements. If you want a wildcard certificate (i.e. one which will work for any subdomain) you will need to pay for it. I&amp;rsquo;m a cheapskate, so I have several free ones instead; it makes no real difference.StartSSL will produce a key and a certificate for you, which you should copy-paste to yourdomain-locked.key and yourdomain-nochain.crt respectively. It will also allow you to download its own key, which is named something like sub.class1.server.sha2.ca.crt.What you do need to do, though, is merge your certificate with that of your certificate authority, and remove the password from the key.Run openssl rsa -in yourdomain-locked.key -out yourdomain.key, and enter the password you used to create the key. That will create one that the server can use.Then run cat yourdomain-nochain.crt sub.class1.server.sha2.ca.crt &amp;gt; yourdomain.crt to create a concatenated certificate file.Transfer the .crt containing the two certificates into /etc/ssl/certs/, and the .key containing the matching key into /etc/ssl/private/.Done all that? Right, go back and do it again; I won&amp;rsquo;t be covering LetsEncrypt, so you&amp;rsquo;ll need to get yourself an SSL certificate for the mail. subdomain. Same procedure, just with mail.yourdomain in place of yourdomain for the requests, and &amp;lsquo;mail-yourdomain&amp;rsquo; for the names of the files.Create a DropletDigital Ocean is nice enough to do most of the basic server setup for you. Once you&amp;rsquo;ve sorted out registering, giving them your card details and so on, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to start by creating a Droplet. There&amp;rsquo;s a nice select-a-box page which covers the major options, or you can spin up something with pre-installed dependencies for one of a couple of dozen common server uses.In this case, I&amp;rsquo;m using Ubuntu 15.10 x64, $10/month size, in the London datacentre (as close as possible to where I&amp;rsquo;ll be transferring things from and to). Where it asks for the SSH key, it wants id_rsa.pub that was created in the last step. Do NOT give it id_rsa - that is your private key, and should not leave your computer. Ideally you would copy that one off onto a memory stick, because it&amp;rsquo;s needed to get access to the server once you&amp;rsquo;ve locked it down, and you really don&amp;rsquo;t want to lose it.You only want one copy of this, so leave that bit alone, give your new toy something memorable for its hostname, and click &amp;lsquo;create&amp;rsquo;.Bravo! You have a server. You&amp;rsquo;re now paying 0.017 pence per minute for it, so best get cracking.Initial SetupOn the Control Panel (to which you are returned after creating your Droplet) you will be able to see the IP address of the server. For now, that&amp;rsquo;s its only identifier; it doesn&amp;rsquo;t yet have a web address, so we&amp;rsquo;ll fix that first, since DNS changes take a while to propagate. Go back to where you bought your domain name, and find the options for &amp;lsquo;nameservers&amp;rsquo;. For our current purposes, these should be set to &amp;lsquo;ns1.digitalocean.com&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;ns2.digitalocean.com&amp;rsquo;, and (you guessed it) &amp;lsquo;ns3.digitalocean.com&amp;rsquo;. All this does is tell &amp;ldquo;the internet&amp;rdquo; to ask Digital Ocean where to find your site, if anyone sends out a request for that domain name.Back to DO, and over to the &amp;lsquo;Networking&amp;rsquo; tab. Pick &amp;lsquo;Domains&amp;rsquo; from the left hand side, type your domain name into the left box, and select your Droplet from the right dropdown. That will assign your name to your server. It still won&amp;rsquo;t do anything obvious if you type it into a web browser (first because these things take a while to be communicated across the web, and second because we haven&amp;rsquo;t set up a web server yet), but it&amp;rsquo;s there.You&amp;rsquo;ll see there&amp;rsquo;s now an entry for that domain name on the Domains page. Click the little magnifying glass, and you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to see all the DNS entries for that domain, and hence for your server (you can do &amp;lsquo;clever&amp;rsquo; things where one domain points to multiple servers or has subdomains which do; if you need that either you are beyond this level or you&amp;rsquo;re working on something where you really ought to hire a professional). We don&amp;rsquo;t need to do much here. Start with creating a CNAME record for * and your domain; this points all subdomains to your main domain name, allowing your web server to take care of the detail and for people not to get lost if they accidentally type &amp;lsquo;wwww.&amp;rsquo; instead of &amp;lsquo;www.&amp;rsquo; (because people are dumb and we have to account for that).We also, assuming you want an email address, need an MX record. Hostname is either yourdomain or mail.yourdomain; either will work, the latter is more usual. Priority is 20. This needs to be paired with another A record; mail. -&amp;gt; your droplet IP.Test this with host yourdomain, which will (all being well) return:yourdomain has address {IP address of server} yourdomain mail is handled by 20 yourdomain.  Depending on how fast things are going today, you may now be able to open up a terminal and run ssh root@{yourdomain} and get something sensible - you gave it your SSH key, so it should just log you in. If it insists that your domain doesn&amp;rsquo;t go anywhere, you either typed it wrong or you need to wait a while, so use ssh root@{ip-of-your-droplet}. You should see a prompt, something like this:Welcome to Ubuntu 15.10 (GNU/Linux 4.2.0-16-generic x86_64) * Documentation: https://help.ubuntu.com/ Last login: {now} from {your IP address} root@{hostname}:~#  Unless specified otherwise, everything from now on needs to be run in this shell. If you run it in the shell on your computer, it will not affect your server and you may screw up your PC, so pay attention to which environment you&amp;rsquo;re typing in.Before you do anything else, though, you need to update properly.sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get upgrade sudo apt-get dist-upgrade  That&amp;rsquo;ll bring you up to date and ready for the next phase.Setting up a web serverPresumably you&amp;rsquo;re doing this because you want a website, which means you&amp;rsquo;re going to need a web server. In this case I&amp;rsquo;m using Nginx; Apache is a perfectly good choice, but it&amp;rsquo;s slightly more of a pain to configure.You can start this up fairly simply by running sudo apt-get install nginx, which will download and install the core files and services required. Check it&amp;rsquo;s working by opening a browser and navigating to your domain name; you should see the Nginx &amp;lsquo;yup, it works, now do something useful with it&amp;rsquo; welcome page.Since we&amp;rsquo;re working on it, issue sudo service nginx stop to shut it down for now. In case it hasn&amp;rsquo;t happened already, you&amp;rsquo;ll want to tell Nginx to restart when your server restarts, so issue sudo update-rc.d nginx defaults - if it tells you there was an error because the rules already exist, that&amp;rsquo;s fine.The default page for Nginx isn&amp;rsquo;t that useful, so we need to create a proto-website (to prove it&amp;rsquo;s running) and a configuration file to tell Nginx how to serve it.Start by disabling the default page: sudo rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default Then create your new config file: sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/yourdomain - this will open up a text editor.The config file should look something like this:server { listen 80 default_server; server_name yourdomain.com www.yourdomain.com; return 301 https://$server_name$request_uri; } #This redirects all insecure traffic via https. server { listen 443; ssl on; ssl_certificate /etc/ssl/certs/yourdomain.crt; ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/private/yourdomain.key; root /var/www/yoursitename/public_html/; index index.html index.htm; server_name yourdomain.com www.yourdomain.com; location / { try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html; } }  Save and exit with ctrl-x -&amp;gt; y -&amp;gt; EnterYou then need to link that (which is, after all, just an available site) to the enabled folder. This is just a symlink: ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/yourdomain /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/yourdomain/. You should see if you ls /etc/nginx/sites-available that you have just the one link in there, to your new config.This doesn&amp;rsquo;t do anything useful yet - as you can tell, since /var/www/yoursitename/public_html/ doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist yet. Let&amp;rsquo;s fix that.sudo mkdir -p /var/www/yoursitename/public_html will create the folder, and then sudo nano /var/www/yoursitename/public_html/index.html will create an index page for editing.&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Congrats, it works!&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now go do something useful with it...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;  Save that, then start up Nginx with sudo service Nginx start. It should spin up with no errors, and if you then go back to your browser and navigate to your domain, you should see your page.Mail ServerNext step is a touch harder, but worth the trouble; I&amp;rsquo;m afraid it&amp;rsquo;ll be a wall of text, though, because it&amp;rsquo;s almost all just a few huge config files.Start with installing our dependencies: sudo apt-get install postfix dovecot-core dovecot-imapd, and stopping the new services: sudo postfix stop &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sudo service dovecot stop.Then you need to create your Postfix configuration: sudo rm /etc/postfix/master.cf &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sudo nano /etc/postfix/master.cf - this will remove the defaults, and open a blank version, which then needs to look like this:smtp inet n - - - - smtpd submission inet n - - - - smtpd -o syslog_name=postfix/submission -o smtpd_tls_security_level=encrypt -o smtpd_tls_wrappermode=no -o smtpd_sasl_auth_enable=yes -o smtpd_sasl_security_options=noanonymous -o smtpd_sasl_local_domain=YOURDOMAIN -o smtpd_recipient_restrictions=permit_mynetworks,permit_sasl_authenticated,reject -o milter_macro_daemon_name=ORIGINATING -o smtpd_sasl_type=dovecot -o smtpd_sasl_path=private/auth -o broken_sasl_auth_clients=yes pickup unix n - - 60 1 pickup cleanup unix n - - - 0 cleanup qmgr unix n - n 300 1 qmgr #qmgr unix n - n 300 1 oqmgr tlsmgr unix - - - 1000? 1 tlsmgr rewrite unix - - - - - trivial-rewrite bounce unix - - - - 0 bounce defer unix - - - - 0 bounce trace unix - - - - 0 bounce verify unix - - - - 1 verify flush unix n - - 1000? 0 flush proxymap unix - - n - - proxymap proxywrite unix - - n - 1 proxymap smtp unix - - - - - smtp relay unix - - - - - smtp showq unix n - - - - showq error unix - - - - - error retry unix - - - - - error discard unix - - - - - discard local unix - n n - - local virtual unix - n n - - virtual lmtp unix - - - - - lmtp anvil unix - - - - 1 anvil scache unix - - - - 1 scache maildrop unix - n n - - pipe flags=DRhu user=vmail argv=/usr/bin/maildrop -d ${recipient} uucp unix - n n - - pipe flags=Fqhu user=uucp argv=uux -r -n -z -a$sender - $nexthop!rmail ($recipient) ifmail unix - n n - - pipe flags=F user=ftn argv=/usr/lib/ifmail/ifmail -r $nexthop ($recipient) bsmtp unix - n n - - pipe flags=Fq. user=bsmtp argv=/usr/lib/bsmtp/bsmtp -t$nexthop -f$sender $recipient scalemail-backend unix - n n - 2 pipe flags=R user=scalemail argv=/usr/lib/scalemail/bin/scalemail-store ${nexthop} ${user} ${extension} mailman unix - n n - - pipe flags=FR user=list argv=/usr/lib/mailman/bin/postfix-to-mailman.py ${nexthop} ${user}  Good thing we have copy-paste, because that does take a while to type and you can&amp;rsquo;t miss out any of the symbols.Similarly, we need to fix up /etc/postfix/main.cf: sudo rm /etc/postfix/main.cf &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sudo nano /etc/postfix/main.cfThen paste this slightly smaller monstrosity:myhostname = MAIL.YOURDOMAIN myorigin = YOURDOMAIN mydestination = YOURDOMAIN, MAIL.YOURDOMAIN, localhost, localhost.localdomain relayhost = mynetworks = 127.0.0.0/8 [::ffff:127.0.0.0]/104 [::1]/128 mailbox_size_limit = 0 recipient_delimiter = + inet_interfaces = all alias_maps = hash:/etc/aliases alias_database = hash:/etc/aliases smtpd_tls_cert_file=/etc/ssl/certs/mail-yourdomain.crt smtpd_tls_key_file=/etc/ssl/private/mail-yourdomain.key smtpd_use_tls=yes smtpd_tls_session_cache_database = btree:${data_directory}/smtpd_scache smtp_tls_session_cache_database = btree:${data_directory}/smtp_scache smtpd_tls_security_level=may smtpd_tls_protocols = !SSLv2, !SSLv3 local_recipient_maps = proxy:unix:passwd.byname $alias_maps  Did you spot that alias-maps? We need to make that, or it won&amp;rsquo;t find anybody if someone emails any of the admin possibilities.sudo nano /etc/aliases, then paste the following:mailer-daemon: root hostmaster: root webmaster: root postmaster: root www: root ftp: root abuse: root root: root  That just makes sure nothing falls through the cracks.Now we go to work on Dovecot, the other half of the equation.sudo nano /etc/dovecot/dovecot.confdisable_plaintext_auth = no mail_privileged_group = mail mail_location = mbox:~/mail:INBOX=/var/mail/%u ssl=required ssl_cert = &amp;lt;/etc/ssl/certs/mail-yourdomain.crt ssl_key = &amp;lt;/etc/ssl/private/mail-yourdomain.key userdb { driver = passwd } passdb { args = %s driver = pam } protocols = &amp;quot; imap&amp;quot; protocol imap { mail_plugins = &amp;quot; autocreate&amp;quot; } plugin { autocreate = Trash autocreate2 = Sent autosubscribe = Trash autosubscribe2 = Sent } service auth { unix_listener /var/spool/postfix/private/auth { group = postfix mode = 0660 user = postfix } }  And you should have a working mail server. Restart everything: newaliases &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sudo postfix start &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sudo service dovecot start, and if nothing throws an error you&amp;rsquo;re almost there.The last thing to do, of course, is create an account. The way Digital Ocean starts things up, you&amp;rsquo;re probably running all this as Root. That&amp;rsquo;s not all that handy, and besides, you want your name. So you need to add yourself as a user, which will automatically create a mail account for you.sudo adduser YOURNAME and follow the instructions; once that&amp;rsquo;s done, su - YOURNAME and you should be presented with a new prompt; one for you, rather than Root. exit to return to the root shell. From a shell on your PC, run ssh-copy-id YOURNAME@YOURWEBADDRESS and when prompted give the password for the account you just created.At this point you probably want to give your new user sudo permissions, so that you can avoid using Root at all; run visudo and put YOURNAME ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL beneath the line that&amp;rsquo;s already there. Then go to /etc/ssh/sshd_config, find the line which says PermitRootLogin and set it to &amp;lsquo;no&amp;rsquo;. While you&amp;rsquo;re here, you should also set ChallengeResponseAuthentication, PasswordAuthentication and UsePAM to &amp;lsquo;no&amp;rsquo;.Now it&amp;rsquo;s time to attempt to login and send some mail with Thunderbird (or your mail client of choice). The username is YOURNAME (not YOURNAME@yourdomain), the IMAP port is 993, the SMTP port is 587, and you&amp;rsquo;re using &amp;lsquo;normal password&amp;rsquo; with STARTTLS.Publishing a WebsiteOK, so you now have working email and a running webserver. You&amp;rsquo;ll be wanting to publish something under the web address, so you need a convenient and fast way to transfer things to the server. The handiest, neatest way of doing this is with a Git repository, and a post-receive script (FTP went out with the nineties).If you don&amp;rsquo;t have Git on your local machine, go get that. Then do the same for the server. In both cases, the command is just sudo apt-get install git. We&amp;rsquo;ll get to what it&amp;rsquo;s for in a moment.Currently, your website is owned by Root. That&amp;rsquo;s not exactly secure, now is it?Let&amp;rsquo;s make a new person: sudo adduser yoursite-admin again, and assign ownership to them: sudo chown -R yoursite-admin /var/www/yoursitename/. This person also needs to have root privileges for some things, so sudo visudo and add the line yoursite-admin ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL just underneath the equivalent line for YOURNAME. You should also add Defaults insults underneath the other Defaults declarations.Now just su - yoursite-admin and you can start getting ready to publish.You should already be in ~, as that&amp;rsquo;s the default when you switch users with -. Run mkdir yoursite.git &amp;amp;&amp;amp; cd yoursite.git &amp;amp;&amp;amp; git init --bare This will create a new Git repository, especially for you to push files to. You need to tell it what to do with them, though.nano /hooks/post-receive#!/usr/bin/env ruby # post-receive from, to, branch = ARGF.read.split &amp;quot; &amp;quot; if (branch =~ /master$/) == nil exit end deploy_to_dir = File.expand_path(&#39;/var/www/yoursitename/public_html/&#39;) `GIT_WORK_TREE=&amp;quot;#{deploy_to_dir}&amp;quot; git checkout -f master` puts &amp;quot;Successfully deployed to &#39;#{deploy_to_dir}&#39;&amp;quot;  This won&amp;rsquo;t do much without Ruby, though. The best way to get hold of this is via the Ruby Version Manager:gpg --keyserver hkp://keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys 409B6B1796C275462A1703113804BB82D39DC0E3 \\curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --rails source ~/.rvm/scripts/rvm rvm install 2.2 rvm use 2.2  Then ruby -v should tell you that you&amp;rsquo;re on Ruby version 2.2.1, if all went well.What&amp;rsquo;s happening here is that the Git repository was created without a Working Tree, or a place to keep its data. All it is, without that, is a record of the changes you&amp;rsquo;ve made. The post-receive script notices when a push is made, pulls all the relevant files, and deploys them to the designated location - in this case, the web root of your site.You now need to set this up as your remote. Assuming you have a Git repository containing your website files already on your computer, this is relatively straightforward. Move back to your local machine&amp;rsquo;s terminal, and add a remote: git remote add yoursite ssh://yoursite-admin@yourdomain/~/yoursite.git. Then git add -A &amp;amp;&amp;amp; git commit -am &amp;quot;first push to new server&amp;quot;, followed by git push yoursite master. With any luck, this won&amp;rsquo;t tell you that yoursite is not a Git repository, and will push to production. Browsing to https://yourdomain should then display the website you&amp;rsquo;ve been aiming for all along.It&amp;rsquo;s worth doing this again, but slightly differently. Create another Nginx server file, named something like testing-yoursite and with a server name of testing.yourdomain, along with the related /var/www/ folders. Then, with the same user you created for the main site, create another Git repository and give it a post-receive file which points to this second path. The post-receive file ought to lack the if branch... block. Now you can deploy speculative changes to a staging area, including branches, and see if they break anything (when in essentially the exact same environment as the production site) and tidy things up if they do.I won&amp;rsquo;t cover the somewhat trial-and-error experience of moving a Ghost blog from one server to another; suffice it to say that the export/import procedure in the &amp;lsquo;Labs&amp;rsquo; page is very handy.Any queries on this, you can ping me and I&amp;rsquo;ll endeavour to help - my email is on the main site.",

  "body": "I promised quite a long time ago, now, to give you all the rest of my recipe for not-actually-cassoulet. The confit duck legs of the previous recipe are one component of this; today you get the rest. Lucky you! I suggest you do the legs first since they need several days to mature.The topping on this variant happens to be gluten-free, which was originally just because a friend of mine has this habit of getting rather ill when she eats bread, but turned out to be a rather tasty alternative to breadcrumbs.This is not low salt. Nor is it low fat, low calorie, low sugar, or otherwise boring. Portion accordingly - this recipe will serve between eight and twelve.Without further ado:The BeansIngredients: Three tins (3x300g) flageolet beans, drained and rinsed with cold water Two (2) shallots, diced One (1) onion, diced Quarter (¼) tbsp. fresh thyme leaves (removed from stalks) Quarter (¼) tbsp. fresh rosemary needles (removed from stalks) One (1) bay leaf One (1) tsp crushed red chilli flakes Pinch of salt, pepper One (1) glass of dry white wine (about 125ml)  Procedure:This bit&amp;rsquo;s not hard. Toss everything in a saucepan together, cover (plus a cm or so) with boiling water, boil for ten minutes. Have a sandwich or something.You need all of this, but not at the same time; strain the wet bit into a jug (which I&amp;rsquo;m going to refer to as Jug One from now, because we like giving innocuous things important-sounding names. The rest you keep in Bowl One.Right, good job. On to:The VegetablesIngredients: 180g diced pancetta. You could buy pre-diced, or you could go down to the deli and have them cut you a chunk off the pork belly to dice yourself. I leave it to you to guess which usually tastes better. Three (3) tbsp. duck fat Six (6) carrots, peeled and sliced thickly One (1) onion, diced One (1) shallot, diced One (1) small head of garlic, all cloves stripped of skin, chopped roughly Three (3) tins chopped Italian tomatoes, mostly drained Salt, pepper (as always)  Procedure:Start by getting your frying pan nice and hot, and give it a smallish spoonful of the duck fat to get cracking on. When you think it&amp;rsquo;s ready, add all the pancetta and fry until crispy. Keep it moving or it&amp;rsquo;ll probably weld itself to the pan, which is no good because those bits are nowhere near as tasty and there&amp;rsquo;s some evidence to suggest that burned meat is a carcinogen. Who wants cancer, hm?Once it&amp;rsquo;s crispy, drain off the fat and transfer the meat to Bowl OneThe pan&amp;rsquo;s still hot, so add another spoonful of the fat and all the carrots. Season and toss until soft and golden around the edges, then the same again - out with the fat, carrots in the bowl with the pancetta.With the last of the fat, you need to sweat the alliums, then (leaving them in the pan) add the tomatoes, simmer for about twenty minutes, then add to the bowl, stir, and cover so nothing escapes.The MeatThis is where it really stops being cassoulet, or so my French chef friend informs me. True cassoulet should have sausage in it. That doesn&amp;rsquo;t really work for me, so I use duck breasts. Six of them, to be precise.Preheat your oven to 465K. While that&amp;rsquo;s heating up, lay out your duck breasts skin up, and score the skin and fat without cutting the meat. Shake a little salt over them, then flip them over into a roasting tin. Roast for about a quarter of an hour, then rest for five minutes; you don&amp;rsquo;t want to take much longer for the roasting or they&amp;rsquo;ll be tough, which is sad.Slice into cubes of about an inch, then add to Bowl Two. Tip the meat juices into Jug One.Retrieve your confit duck legs from under their fat by warming them gently in the oven. Pull them into chunks with a pair of forks, and add those to Bowl Two as well.The CrumbsIngredients: 300g corn flakes 150g hazelnuts One (1) tablespoon rice flour Zest of two lemons Juice of one lemon Three (3) tablespoons olive oil A good handful of grated parmesan One (1) level tbsp of brown sugar  ProcedureBlend. That&amp;rsquo;s it. Not much of a procedure, is it? All together in the food processor, blitz until fluffy crumbs.The Final AssemblyBowl One now contains all vegetable components, and Bowl Two now contains all meat components. Jug One now contains all fluid components except water.ProcedureYour oven should already be hot from roasting the duck breast, so set it to 450K while you assemble the cassoulet in the biggest casserole dish you can find.Cover the bottom of casserole dish with half of the vegetable mixture, followed by all the meat. Top with the remaining vegetables so you have the start of a delicious bread-free sandwich. Add all the liquid, topping up with hot water if necessary until the liquid just shows through the vegetables.Cook, without covering, for 45 minutes to an hour, so all the flavours meld. Remove from the oven.Cover the surface of the cassoulet with an even layer of the breadcrumbs. Scatter with a little brown sugar, return to the oven and bake for about 45 minutes, until the surface of the breadcrumb layer is browned and cracked.Allow to cool for an hour before eating; it will still be hot.So there you go. The rest of the recipe. Rather large, and not really scalable, as such; best kept for dinner parties, funerals, and other festive occasions.",

  "body": "This one was actually done on a Sunday, but you&amp;rsquo;re getting it on Wednesday because how else does one maintain a new tradition?Confit duck leg isn&amp;rsquo;t exactly complex, though there&amp;rsquo;s a fair bit in the sauce here, but it&amp;rsquo;s delicious and sounds impressive, if that&amp;rsquo;s something you go for in your food. Duck itself is a fairly versatile meat, so long as you don&amp;rsquo;t overwhelm the flavour. In this instance it&amp;rsquo;s paired with orange, which is classic, but there are an awful lot of options. This is also a ingredient in another recipe which I will at some point post here - cassoulet. Start three days early - if you want it for Saturday dinner, start on Wednesday night.Duck Confit with Marmalade Sauce (serves 4)Ingredients Four duck legs Juniper berries Black pepper Half a head of garlic 150g salt 75g caster sugar About a kilo of duck fat Ground cinnamon Ground allspice Half a jar of marmalade 500ml vegetable or chicken stock Glass dry white wine 40ml soy sauce 25ml mirin 25ml Dijon mustard 200ml freshly squeezed orange juice One onion 50g butter Starch granules (or for the less lazy than me, half a floury potato diced really fine) Four handfuls of red or wild rice  MethodSo, first up, you&amp;rsquo;ll be desiccating your duck legs. Since most desiccants are not in the slightest bit tasty, the tradition here is sea salt, which (being hygroscopic) does the job excellently. During this process, we&amp;rsquo;ll be taking the opportunity to get some interesting flavours into the meat as well.Dice your half head of garlic, set it aside. You&amp;rsquo;ll need it in a bit, but it&amp;rsquo;s a nice easy start, and we all like that, right? Besides, it smells awesome.Get yourself a box like this: Important factors here: it seals, and it has the rack in the bottom to give it a bit of space underneath the meat. Arrange your duck legs artistically in the box, and then sprinkle salt (all of it), juniper berries, the caster sugar, that garlic you shredded, and lots of ground black pepper (use an actual grinder. I&amp;rsquo;m sure you don&amp;rsquo;t own the powdered stuff, but just in case&amp;hellip;).Now it gets boring for a while. Seal up the box, hide it in the fridge for a couple of days. Yup, days. Blame kinetics, this is a slow process....&amp;hellip;Back already? Excellent. Preheat the oven to about 390K. Grab your box, which should now have a slurry of salty, sugary duck-water on the bottom, and retrieve the duck legs. If they quack, you need to leave them in a bit longer. Rinse the salt and flavourings off, and set them in a casserole dish. Needs to be a fairly tight fit, so don&amp;rsquo;t go overboard on dish diameter. Dust with cinnamon, allspice and pepper, then cover with the duck fat. You&amp;rsquo;ll need more than you think; the legs need to be completely submerged in molten fat. If you&amp;rsquo;re watching your weight, don&amp;rsquo;t worry (also, why are you here?), you won&amp;rsquo;t be eating all of it. Casserole dish needs a lid, then makes its way to the oven for about three hours.For the sauce, start by heating up the marmalade, stock, wine and orange juice to a simmer. Use a whisk to stir, it helps dissolve the marmalade faster. Once the marmalade is dissolved, add the butter, soy sauce, mirin, mustard, the starch source, and the onion (diced). Raise to a boil, lower to a simmer, and reduce until you have about half a pint of fairly thick sauce. Shortly before serving, pour through a sieve into a jug, taking care not to get too much on the floor. A funnel helps here.Wild rice takes about 25-30 minutes to cook, but I&amp;rsquo;m going to assume you know how to boil rice, so just start early enough and all is good.Once the duck legs are sufficiently tender that a fork will pass through them with no resistance, (no, that solid bit is bone, try a different angle) extract them from the oven, recover from the fat, and place on a grill rack. Grill for about a minute, skin-side up, just to get the skin crispy. Watch carefully, because it will go black very fast due to the sugar we soaked into the skin in the first step.Per plate; duck leg, rice, sauce over all, plus whatever greens you choose. Swiss chard goes well, as would red cabbage.",

  "body": "The strange thing about this film is that it&amp;rsquo;s worth watching repeatedly. That&amp;rsquo;s usually just the mark of a good film, but given the premise involves a man repeating a single day of his life for what appears to be several subjective decades (or perhaps centuries), there&amp;rsquo;s a certain sense of the appropriate in its revisitability.On this watching, I was struck by something that I&amp;rsquo;d somehow missed the implications of before. The protagonist, on discovering that he is repeating February 2nd, initially reacts as you might expect a rational person to do: examine his environment, assume that he is losing his sanity (this is generally more likely than magic, regardless of your situation), and finally panic. He then proceeds to act like an impulsive moron for a while before descending into depression. The flurry of subsequent suicides is maybe not the mark of a sensible person, but it is followed by a phase that finally makes use of the situation: focussed self-improvement.It&amp;rsquo;s tempting to see this as an allegory for a certain sort of childhood. You realise (generally not one morning, but over time) that time is passing and you have effects on the world. You muck around for a few years, then you start to feel trapped, you spend your teenage years wearing black and listening to awful music&amp;hellip; and then you have a choice to make.It&amp;rsquo;s very straightforward to go for the easy way out. Get a degree in something that doesn&amp;rsquo;t interest you, because university is the thing to do. Get a job that you&amp;rsquo;re not all that enthused by, because being an employee is the thing to do and you need the money more than you want the time. Forty years later you retire, if you&amp;rsquo;ve earned enough, having taken few risks and experienced few failures, and spend your time playing golf or sunbathing on a beach somewhere. Maybe you buy an unreasonably fast car on credit and pretend that counts as self-worth. That sort of thing.It&amp;rsquo;s not quite suicide. But it&amp;rsquo;s pretty close.The alternative? Emulate Bill Murray. Once he comes to terms with the fact that he has unlimited do-overs, that he can try anything he likes and learn everything (or at least everything available in a 6000-person pre-internet town in Pennsylvania), he does. And yes, it takes him some reasonable approximation of forever, but the principle is one that&amp;rsquo;s fairly straightforward to follow. The trick is that in his case, not fearing failure is fully justified. We who inhabit a world where opportunity costs are a thing, and where there are consequences to fuckups (not to mention driving on railway tracks), have to be a little more circumspect. But that&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;a little&amp;rsquo;, not &amp;lsquo;overwhelmingly&amp;rsquo;.I haven&amp;rsquo;t been exactly innocent of this myself. Decision paralysis, akrasia and fear of failure are more frequently things I notice after I&amp;rsquo;ve already made a decision, rather than having the opportunity to address them as they happen.1It&amp;rsquo;s easy to say &amp;ldquo;go out and attempt things&amp;rdquo;. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t cost me anything to say that, or for you to read it and think &amp;ldquo;that&amp;rsquo;s a great idea, I should try to do that at some point&amp;rdquo;. That doesn&amp;rsquo;t make it false. If you want to learn the piano, go find yourself a piano teacher. If you want to learn to code, pick a language and get started with Codecademy - although it&amp;rsquo;s faster to start your own project rather than just working through their examples. Anything is more productive (not to mention more enlivening and enjoyable) than sitting in your pyjamas watching Netflix for three days straight2. Even the simple stuff. Never been skydiving? That&amp;rsquo;s £150 and one day of your time. Not exactly a hike to Mordor.We&amp;rsquo;re not immortal. Yet. Every day you don&amp;rsquo;t start something you want to do is a day less time you have to get it done, and just that little bit harder to learn something new.Where are your barriers? Brienne Yudkowsky has some helpful ways to begin to address this problem here and here. [return] I say this as someone for whom that has occasionally been a life choice. It happens to everyone.

This is one of those rare ones.

  "body": "It&amp;rsquo;s very rare for me to encounter a book which affects me enough that I have to put it down every few pages, think about it, and take notes. This is one of those rare ones. It&amp;rsquo;s certainly not for everyone, but if you&amp;rsquo;re looking for inspiration and for encouragement in being more effective, you&amp;rsquo;ll start getting your fix about half a chapter in - and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t let up.Marshall sets out his ambition to become &amp;lsquo;the finest strategist of a generation&amp;rsquo;, and then goes on to reveal how, precisely, he believes it will be possible for him to achieve this. From the wrong station in Japan to cafés and boardrooms across Europe, we are made privy to his introspection and planning.This starts out with a list, which I paraphrase below. Develop your own ethical system Make good friends, advisors and mentors on purpose Learn universally useful skills Earn a few credentials Get some money in the bank, and good credit reputation Study history to learn what&amp;rsquo;s possible Establish good habits rather than relying on willpower Become very fit and healthy Teach yourself how to think  There&amp;rsquo;s no particular order to these, he just calls them &amp;lsquo;useful things to be doing&amp;rsquo;, and I certainly agree with most of them. I can&amp;rsquo;t see a point to having an ethical system (even in the context of the book, it seems relevant only to his own particular goals). He also thinks having children is a worthwhile use of life, so I&amp;rsquo;m not inclined to listen to everything he says.One consistent theme throughout the book is studying great men and women to see what they did that made them effective. Their exact actions are frequently not the relevant factor; behaviours and character traits, especially as reported by those who followed and served them, are more regularly concentrated upon. This makes sense in context, although I found his emphasis on the Sengoku Period of Japan to be less helpful than it might have been, given my complete ignorance of Japanese history and culture.1The one insight which affected me most actually comes very near the beginning of the book, as he talks about comparing oneself to a peer group or to one&amp;rsquo;s own ambition. There is what I have long considered a failure mode where people compare themselves only to where they expected to be, or to their local peers such as schoolmates and siblings, and conclude that actually they&amp;rsquo;re doing acceptably well just because they compare favourably to that particular low bar. There&amp;rsquo;s an aversion among many, which Marshall points out (I&amp;rsquo;m somewhat glad to discover I&amp;rsquo;ve not been imagining it) to comparing themselves to where they could be, because that invariably rearranges one&amp;rsquo;s mental map such that one is &amp;ldquo;at the bottom of a much larger mountain, rather than high up on a small one&amp;rdquo;.It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter that you&amp;rsquo;re doing better than your school friends, or &amp;lsquo;people your age&amp;rsquo;. They&amp;rsquo;re not the benchmark. Alexander of Macedon had conquered Europe, North Africa, and most of the way across Asia by the time he was thirty. Albert Einstein published his paper on Special Relativity at age 26. What did you do last year?I&amp;rsquo;ve long been fighting to reconcile my own feelings - that I should be doing considerably more, even though I don&amp;rsquo;t know how - with the &amp;lsquo;reassuring&amp;rsquo; common attitude that these people were somehow special superhumans, and thus it&amp;rsquo;s OK not to aspire to achieve so much. Ikigai helped me realise that this is a false battle; it&amp;rsquo;s not OK.I thoroughly recommend this book, iff you&amp;rsquo;re willing to put the effort into it, and to make the mental adjustments necessary to internalise what it says. You&amp;rsquo;ll know you&amp;rsquo;re doing it right when you feel like ineffective crap and can&amp;rsquo;t help but want to do something about that.You do have to remember that the book is compiled and edited from the author&amp;rsquo;s blog posts over the course of some considerable time. The style varies as the book goes on, and the order of chapters very occasionally feels slightly &amp;lsquo;off&amp;rsquo;; presumably because the posts themselves were not in a strict order of ideas to begin with. I&amp;rsquo;m still not interested, but it certainly seems like something I ought to know about, so I&amp;rsquo;ll be looking into that. [return]   ",

Lateness due to difficulties in actually retrieving said photographs.Pork Fillet with Figs and Tallegio - Serves three. Two if you&amp;rsquo;re hungry. Four if you&amp;rsquo;re small.Ingredients One whole pork fillet 6-8 dried figs ~125ml dry sherry 150g Tallegio D.O.P 1 A dozen or so sprigs fresh rosemary Salt Pepper Courgettes Butter Red wild rice Cream  MethodTo start off, you want to get the figs drunk. They&amp;rsquo;re parched, it&amp;rsquo;s only kind. Sit them in a bowl, covered with the sherry, for at least an hour or so before you start doing anything else.Take your pork fillet, and lay it on a wooden or plastic board (not glass, unless you like eating glass shards), with clingfilm between it and the board. Slit it down the centre about 3&amp;frasl;4 of the way through, lay it out flat, then cover with clingfilm and beat it with a meat mallet until about 8-10mm thick and fully tenderised.Dice your tallegio into ~12mm blocks. Discard the orange skin, it&amp;rsquo;s not especially tasty.Extract your figs from the sherry and remove their stalks. This should open up a handy cavity, into each of which you need to press a block of tallegio. Lay your stuffed figs in a line down the long axis of the flattened pork, tight against each other. Do remember to remove the clingfilm, it melts and smokes in the oven and doesn&amp;rsquo;t add much to the flavour. Dash of salt and a fair bit of pepper, then roll the pork around the figs and tie it up with string.In an ovenproof dish, lay all the rosemary sprigs in a line, then place the pork on top of them. Pour the sherry which the figs were soaking in over the pork, then send the whole lot into the oven at 453K.You&amp;rsquo;ll have quite a bit of tallegio left over. That goes into a saucepan, along with about 30g of butter and 3tbsp of cream, plus liberal pepper and a little salt. Low heat, melt and stir until homogeneous liquid is obtained.Rice goes in a pan, covered, with water. About eighteen minutes should do it. Courgettes can either be steamed, as here, or fried in butter. Either way they take moments.Once the meat is done, pull from the oven and allow to rest while you give each plate a portion of rice and courgettes. Slice thickly, distribute, and pour the dairy over.Nom. This is a soft, moderately strong-smelling cheese. Substitute accordingly if necessary. If you like blue cheese, Stilton might work well.

Anyone not convinced about bacon, halloumi, mango and black pepper, just try it - it&amp;rsquo;s a great salad all by itself.This one happens to be gluten free, but if you want to sub out the cornflakes for breadcrumbs or panko, it&amp;rsquo;ll work just fine. I suppose you could also batter them, if you wanted something more portable.Pulled Pork Arancini (sort of 1) - Serves 6IngredientsFor the arancini: 800g boned pork shoulder 100g diced fennel 1 chopped celery stick 300g sushi or risotto rice2 2 tbsp mirin 2 tbsp rice vinegar 2 tbsp caster sugar 4 tbsp liquid honey Handful of cloves Water 1 tsp monosodium glutamate Salt Pepper Several handfuls of crushed cornflakesFor the sauce: 2 tbsp soy sauce 1 tbsp balsamic vinegar 100g brown sugar 250ml draught Guinness 70g tomato purée 1 finely-diced chilli3To serve: 6 rashers back bacon 1 ripe mango 300g halloumi in 8mm slicesMethodPlace the pork shoulder in a small casserole. Add the honey, the fennel, the celery and the cloves, then top up with water to just below the top of the pork. With the lid on, cook for four hours at ~450K, turning over around every 45 minutes.Around an hour before the pork is due to finish, set your rice to simmer, covered, under its own volume of water. In a separate saucepan, mix the mirin, rice vinegar, caster sugar, MSG and 2tsp salt. Simmer and stir until everything has dissolved, then leave to cool to room temperature.Once the rice has absorbed all the water, add the mirin mixture and stir it through. Abandon this lot for now, it needs to cool down.You should have some very tender pork by this point, so pull it out of the oven and onto a board. No rush, let it rest for a few minutes. The pan that had the mirin in it is now empty, so the remaining honey and water (there shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be much) goes in there, through a sieve to catch the solids. You don&amp;rsquo;t need the plant bits, chuck &amp;lsquo;em. Follow that with the rest of the sauce ingredients, plus a good measure of black pepper. Bring to a boil, then turn down so it&amp;rsquo;s simmering. Don&amp;rsquo;t cover, this needs to reduce a long way. You&amp;rsquo;ll know it&amp;rsquo;s done when it behaves like honey.Grab yourself a couple of forks, and shred that pork. Should be an easy job if you left it in the oven long enough. Keep pulling it apart, working along the grain, until it&amp;rsquo;s all ribbons. The sauce won&amp;rsquo;t be done yet, but rescue a tablespoon of it and mix up that, the shredded pork, and the rice into one sticky mass. Divide this into six (or however many you feel like, really; just beware that too small and they&amp;rsquo;ll be nasty and hard, too big and they won&amp;rsquo;t fry properly). Put them on a tray and leave to set.Start heating up your deep fryer, and throw your bacon in a large frying pan with the halloumi and some paprika. Roll each of the pork balls in the crushed cornflakes, then once the oil is very hot deep fry them until golden brown.Plate: Chopped bacon, halloumi, a slice of the mango, and a good spoonful of the reduction. Liberal grind of black pepper over the mango. I suspect every culture that inspired a piece of this would be deeply upset with me. Especially the pigs. [return] Short grained, sticky when cooked.

I suppose that would have been too much to hope for a first try. So far, I&amp;rsquo;ve determined that the spark plug works and has a suitable gap (compared with a spare), that the fuel line and air intake are free of debris, and that all components are where they need to be. Fuel placed in the &amp;lsquo;cup&amp;rsquo; of the fuel intake is taken in, but not ignited.I&amp;rsquo;m a little puzzled, so it&amp;rsquo;s back to research for now.Addendum 14/08/15: After some research and further examining the parts, it looks like all the gaskets and seals need replacing. This engine isn&amp;rsquo;t made any more, and spare parts seem few and far between, so I am unlikely to be able to fix it. Especially as it didn&amp;rsquo;t work before I started.I&amp;rsquo;ve learned a great deal, though, so I consider this a partial success despite the fact that the engine will now definitely never run again, rather than just probably.",

It didn&amp;rsquo;t have to carry a laptop, which means smaller pockets and less weight overall.I generated a five-minute sketch to start with:Then switched to SketchUp to refine the idea:Apologies for the huge number of dimensions.Current design is twin semi-independent front sections, sharing a top flap so they appear as joined pockets when it&amp;rsquo;s down. The left, as seen in the first SketchUp drawing, only opens at the front, and will have straps to hold the lunchbox, an elasticated pocket to allow access to the water bottle from both inside and outside the compartment, and some pockets on its flap for cutlery, water purification tablets, matches, hexamine and so on.The right pocket currently doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a layout, but as shown will devolve completely to its net, allowing it to lie flat and display the tools inside. I&amp;rsquo;m undecided on elastic straps vs leather straps with press studs as tool retainers; that&amp;rsquo;ll probably be an aesthetic choice in the end.This will be my first &amp;lsquo;wearable&amp;rsquo; item in a while, and my first ever leatherworking project.

Veal, for those of you not familiar, is young beef - it&amp;rsquo;s tender and sweet, without the heavy beef flavour, much as lamb compares to hogget or mutton.Veal and Sweet Potato Pie; Serves 4Ingredients500g lean veal mince.1 75g pancetta, as lardons2 150g butter.3 Two (2) medium onions Two (2) banana shallots Four (4) cloves garlic4 250ml red wine 50ml balsamic vinegar Salt PepperFour (4) sweet potatoes 50ml cream 1&amp;frasl;2 wheel of Boursin5 Grating of parmesan 50g tomato paste Handful of pink peppercorns Handful of chopped chivesThree (3) courgettes NutmegMethodPreheat oven to 473K.Throw about 50-60g of butter into a large frying pan, get it melted and bubbling.Peel and chop the onions, garlic and shallots while the butter is melting; once you have bubbling butter and small chunks of alliums, introduce them to each other. It&amp;rsquo;s OK to cry at this point, but they&amp;rsquo;ll be good friends. Don&amp;rsquo;t put the lid on, we don&amp;rsquo;t want it wet.While that&amp;rsquo;s all softening, peel your courgettes and slice them into ~6mm rounds. Peel the sweet potatoes, chop into rough chunks. They&amp;rsquo;re going to be mashed anyway, so it&amp;rsquo;s not so important that they all be the same, just need to be small enough to cook fast.The courgettes go in a frying pan with about 40g of butter. Don&amp;rsquo;t put it on the heat yet, you&amp;rsquo;re just frontloading while the onions (remember them?) get soft and slightly browned. The sweet potatoes go in a dish with a lid and about 5mm of water on the bottom, and in the microwave on full for ten minutes.Go back to your onions. They miss you. Add the veal, and break it up with a wooden spoon. It should immediately start cooking. Don&amp;rsquo;t add any liquid at this point, just ignore it all for a while, shoving it around and turning it over so it all goes brown rather than wet grey.While that&amp;rsquo;s cooking, throw a party for the cream, Boursin, tomato paste, 50g of butter, and small palmful of grated parmesan in a saucepan, and get it on a low heat. Once the butter is melted, find yourself a balloon whisk and whisk it all together into a stiff reddish-orange paste. Try it, it&amp;rsquo;s yummy (but then as great cooks you&amp;rsquo;ve been tasting everything as we go anyway, right?). Add a liberal amount of salt, a few grinds of pepper, and a small handful of pink peppercorns.By this point the microwave should be yelling at you, so go retrieve your sweet potato chunks. Drain off the water, and add the chunks to the pan with the cheese and tomato mixture. Whisk the whole lot until it&amp;rsquo;s smooth and mashed. If you have a potato masher this would also work, but they&amp;rsquo;re harder to clean and you already have the whisk dirty so you might as well use that.The meat and alliums should be nicely browned by now, so add the balsamic vinegar, stir it through, and wait a minute until most of the wet has vanished again. Repeat with the wine; if this step doesn&amp;rsquo;t smell awesome you bought cheap wine and should check your priorities. If you drank the wine while waiting for the previous steps, that&amp;rsquo;s OK, go get another glass. This one&amp;rsquo;s for the pan, not you.Add your salt and pepper to the meat pan, stir it a bit, make sure it&amp;rsquo;s not grey or soggy. If it is, leave everything and come back in a few minutes.Take an ovenproof dish, start by filling it with the meat mixture. Flatten it out, top it with the sweet potato mixture. Stroke it all flat with a fork so you get nice furrows. Sweet potatoes are wet, so they won&amp;rsquo;t go brown and crunchy on the tips like &amp;lsquo;normal&amp;rsquo; mash does. Sprinkle the chives on top, put it all in the oven. Set an alarm for twenty minutes.While you&amp;rsquo;re waiting for the pie to finish cooking, conjure some heat under those courgettes. The butter will melt, they&amp;rsquo;ll sizzle, they&amp;rsquo;ll go white and then golden brown on the lower surface. Good times. Grate some nutmeg over them for bonus tasties, plus a little powdered salt. Flip them over, repeat the process. Lower the heat once they&amp;rsquo;re done, let them rest a bit.When the alarm startles you, pull the pie from the oven. Plate up: courgettes (slotted spoon, you don&amp;rsquo;t want the remaining molten butter), plus a good portion of pie.This is unashamedly nursery food. Enjoy. I&amp;rsquo;d say organic, but generally the difference isn&amp;rsquo;t that significant. Lean is more important. [return] ~10mm cubes. Don&amp;rsquo;t get the thin sliced stuff, that won&amp;rsquo;t work. I guess you could use bacon bits if that&amp;rsquo;s what you have. [return] Yes, all of it.

Since then the land has been managed by Natural England, so other than dog walkers not much has disturbed it, resulting in a rapid return to woodland.Bearing in mind that this whole area was completely clear on both sides of the current A3 route in about 1950, with concrete and rubble all over, I&amp;rsquo;m quite impressed with the takeover by bracken and oak trees.The survey was done by another group of volunteers some time previously, and they identified a number of locations which might prove interesting, based on the location of the military huts in the drawings. This led to much wandering around pointing at sections of undifferentiated woodland and trying to match them to hand-drawn maps and estimates of &amp;lsquo;we walked about this far&amp;rsquo;.Day one, eight volunteers turned up, plus the three professional archaeologists from the SCAU. The site for Trench One was identified, and the bracken attacked with strimmers and machetes. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t taking many photographs at that point, but other people were[^n].We cleared, we de-turfed, we mattocked. Principle discovery: mattocks are heavy, steel toes are vital equipment. Most of the finds were bottle glass, coal, and crushed slag - this latter one was a bit worrying, because that&amp;rsquo;s used for filling trenches, and that area also reacted to the current meter.We did find a few interesting bits: one empty .303 shell casing, unfired (no strike on the primer), one .303 jacketed bullet (fired, rifling marks still visible), and one .303 training round, with no primer cup, its wooden bullet rotted away, and six holes in the casing so you could tell it couldn&amp;rsquo;t go &amp;lsquo;bang&amp;rsquo;.Trench One was thus abandoned at the end of the day, and will (sans tools, of course) look like this until made good: Day two, same set of people. I didn&amp;rsquo;t arrive until lunchtime due to other commitments, but joined in with Trench Two at around midday. This yielded some window glass, some coal, several bottle pieces including what our bottle expert declared to be the neck of a lemonade bottle, cork included, and half a pair of nineties plastic sunglasses in three pieces.Having cleared and brushed clean Trench Two, we wandered over to see what the other half of the group had been doing in Trench Three. Attempts were clearly being made to dig a canal. There were about six colours of very soft, uncompacted sand coming out of that mound, plus a band of charcoal and burned rocks; given the bullet found shortly after excavation commenced it&amp;rsquo;s possible this was used as a backstop for target practice, but it&amp;rsquo;s not tall enough for that to have been its primary purpose, if indeed there was a purpose. Uncertainty remains whether the mound of sand is intentional or a natural feature, but opinion among the three professionals in the group is that it&amp;rsquo;s probably just natural. We&amp;rsquo;ll know tomorrow.Around the level of the burned section, they did disinter an intact stoneware ginger beer bottle from 1921. Given the area was basically just a nice green bit off the A3 at that time, this probably indicates picnickers rather than a military taste for ginger beer. Day two thus wrapped up cheerfully, with tea and tiffin consumed by all.Sadly, I had to skip the rest of the week due to a combination of real work and torrential rain; there are further weeks arranged for August, so hopefully I shall have the opportunity to return to the dig site then.",

  "body": "I&amp;rsquo;ve been saying for a while that it would be an excellent idea for me to learn how to clean and maintain internal combustion engines. First because they&amp;rsquo;re interesting, and my knowledge of them has been limited to diagrams1, and second because at some point I&amp;rsquo;d like to own a Series 3 Land Rover or early Defender, which is sort of pointless unless I can maintain it myself.2Luckily for me, we had a spare IC-powered strimmer in the garage. Sitting empty and unused (partly because it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t start) for about two decades, it was the perfect victim learning tool; a single cylinder, spark-plug ignition petrol engine, with flywheel. About eight moving parts, and as simple as these things get. I decided that rather than find a manual, I&amp;rsquo;d just dismantle it as far as possible, and try to divine the purpose of each element. Once cleaned and reassembled (and repaired, if I could work out what the problem was), I could check my accuracy by seeing if it would run.First things first: removing the &amp;lsquo;strimmer&amp;rsquo; bit from the engine. This turned out to be a matter of two machine screws; the attachment is a square peg and socket arrangement, caked in grease but otherwise trivial.Having set that aside (not needed for this investigation), I set about dismantling the main body of the engine. The coupling between the engine and the attachment socket was fascinating; a spring, retaining a pair of heavy and well lubricated semicircular weights. These fit inside a cup on the coupling, and would only make contact when spinning fast enough to spread under rotational forces. I think this is so that when manually starting the engine, the weight of the strimmer itself is disconnected. It should also mean that if the strimmer head is jammed, the drive shaft can still rotate freely - given that the housing here was half filled with a mixture of oil and metal shavings, this must have happened a fair bit over the lifetime of the engine.Next step was to remove the petrol tank. The cap is severely broken, with the threaded section detached from the &amp;lsquo;cap&amp;rsquo; bit, so I will have to either source another or repair this one with some glue that is not soluble in petroleum spirits. Maybe Araldite? A problem for reassembly. This was also set aside, and the fuel line examined.Here I discovered the second problem. The fuel filter was perished; the remnants of a black foam disc which when removed from the fuel line fell into two pieces, and while lying on the workbench dissolved utterly into an oily liquid. I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure that means it needed replacing, and may well have been why it wasn&amp;rsquo;t running in the first place. The air filter was similarly perished, though less damp, and simply crumbled to dust as I removed it from the air intake.Removing the cylinder revealed a slightly burned and uneven piston head (I&amp;rsquo;ll need to clean that with a wire brush, I think), but otherwise all seemed in good order. Other than the filters, I can&amp;rsquo;t see a reason this engine wasn&amp;rsquo;t running. The remainder (the flywheel, casing, spark plug and associated circuitry, and pull-cord mechanism) came apart relatively easily, and no problems were evident with any of them.The parts are currently degreasing; I&amp;rsquo;ll scrub them all clean, work out which bits are supposed to be oiled and give them their necessary lubrication, and reassemble with new fuel and air filters. Hopefully the next post (with photographs, this time) on this will be when it&amp;rsquo;s running! A helpful diagram [return] This will also necessitate learning to weld. That will probably be a future blog post, or several. [return]   ",

With the latter, a small amount of very neat and readable Ruby code is leveraged into a working site, but without fine-grained control or obvious mechanism being necessary. Javascript is less forgiving, but much more configurable. I&amp;rsquo;m sure once I understand, rather than simply &amp;lsquo;understanding&amp;rsquo; enough to make it work, there will be many more places to go.I held off on learning JS for a long time, preferring the friendliness of Python and Ruby. I may live to regret that delay, but so far, upskilling is proving fun.Level Up - one skill point.JamieFuture!Jamie here: This does indeed look a bit ridiculous from this end of the year. Moreover it&amp;rsquo;s hopelessly out of date, since I no longer use Angular, Prism or Apache2 for the website&amp;hellip;",
