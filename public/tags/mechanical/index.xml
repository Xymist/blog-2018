      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been saying for a while that it would be an excellent idea for me to learn how to clean and maintain internal combustion engines. First because they&amp;rsquo;re interesting, and my knowledge of them has been limited to diagrams1, and second because at some point I&amp;rsquo;d like to own a Series 3 Land Rover or early Defender, which is sort of pointless unless I can maintain it myself.2
Luckily for me, we had a spare IC-powered strimmer in the garage.</description>
