      <description>It has been quite some time since I last wrote any content for this blog. I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to (the stack of article ideas and &amp;lsquo;TODO:&amp;rsquo; notes keeps growing, which ironically will be the subject of another post) but somehow the time and the will never seemed to coincide. This has mainly come about because I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing some actual useful work, at least some of which has involved some coding, which is always entertaining.</description>
