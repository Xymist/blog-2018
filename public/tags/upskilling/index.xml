      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been saying for a while that it would be an excellent idea for me to learn how to clean and maintain internal combustion engines. First because they&amp;rsquo;re interesting, and my knowledge of them has been limited to diagrams1, and second because at some point I&amp;rsquo;d like to own a Series 3 Land Rover or early Defender, which is sort of pointless unless I can maintain it myself.2
Luckily for me, we had a spare IC-powered strimmer in the garage.</description>

      <description>It doesn&amp;rsquo;t look like much, but the main site is now nicely configured, and the root URL redirects where it&amp;rsquo;s supposed to&amp;hellip; unfortunately not transparently. Still working on that; apparently .htaccess configurations don&amp;rsquo;t play nice with ngRoute.
I&amp;rsquo;ve also set up MathJax and Prism, so when I want to show off crappy code and inaccurate maths, they&amp;rsquo;ll look less crappy and inaccurate.
This is a learning experience, like anything else. These posts rapidly become out of date; hopefully in a few months I can, as ever, look back and laugh at how &amp;lsquo;stupid&amp;rsquo; I was such a short time ago.</description>
