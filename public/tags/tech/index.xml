      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s over a year since I wrote anything here, and &amp;lsquo;here&amp;rsquo; has moved anyway. I was terribly proud when I moved over to Digital Ocean, having never done much in the way of server admin before, and bothered to set up Nginx, Postfix, Dovecot, Nagios, Caddy&amp;hellip; In hindsight, it was sort of an achievement, but it was also a colossal waste of effort in many ways.
In the last year of being employed to do that sort of thing as my day job, I&amp;rsquo;ve realised just how much value there is in getting someone else to do these things for you.</description>
