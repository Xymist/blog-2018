      <description>It has been quite some time since I last wrote any content for this blog. I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to (the stack of article ideas and &amp;lsquo;TODO:&amp;rsquo; notes keeps growing, which ironically will be the subject of another post) but somehow the time and the will never seemed to coincide. This has mainly come about because I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing some actual useful work, at least some of which has involved some coding, which is always entertaining.</description>

      <description>I felt like building something less samey than another test website or to-do list app, so I&amp;rsquo;m working on a text-based adventure. As they say, the two hardest things in computer science are naming things and cache invalidation; consequently this little app labours under the uninspired name of &amp;ldquo;Sloggit&amp;rdquo;, until I can think of a better one.
For the moment there are no caches involved, thankfully, but I am running into the less formally-hard problem of story writing.</description>
