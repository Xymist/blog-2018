      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re considering teaching yourself to code, or even just to code in a new language, I heartily recommend you take a look at Project Euler. It&amp;rsquo;s essentially a collection of user-submitted maths questions, sufficiently tricky as to require solving by a computer, but sufficiently unintensive that programs capable of solving them can run in a reasonable time.
The mathematics themselves are done by your code, but the real challenge lies in thinking through the necessary algorithms and program flow such that you can build something which fulfils the requirements.</description>
