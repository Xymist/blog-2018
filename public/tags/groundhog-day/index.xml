      <description>The strange thing about this film is that it&amp;rsquo;s worth watching repeatedly. That&amp;rsquo;s usually just the mark of a good film, but given the premise involves a man repeating a single day of his life for what appears to be several subjective decades (or perhaps centuries), there&amp;rsquo;s a certain sense of the appropriate in its revisitability.
On this watching, I was struck by something that I&amp;rsquo;d somehow missed the implications of before.</description>
