      <description>This week, someone else&amp;rsquo;s hands were doing the cooking, so I could and did remember to take photographs. Credit due Fiona for this one; we don&amp;rsquo;t know where the recipe originated. Lateness due to difficulties in actually retrieving said photographs.
Pork Fillet with Figs and Tallegio - Serves three. Two if you&amp;rsquo;re hungry. Four if you&amp;rsquo;re small.
Ingredients
 One whole pork fillet 6-8 dried figs ~125ml dry sherry 150g Tallegio D.</description>

      <description>This is one of those recipes where I can sort of see how it came into being, but it&amp;rsquo;s a long way from its starting points. The rice preparation is sushi base, the pulled pork goes well in sandwiches, arancini are Italian. Culturally horrifying? Sure. So sue me, it tastes great. Anyone not convinced about bacon, halloumi, mango and black pepper, just try it - it&amp;rsquo;s a great salad all by itself.</description>
