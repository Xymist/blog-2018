      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to do recipes on Wednesdays, because routine is comforting and food is important. Or the other way around, I can never remember.
It was wet, cold, and dark all day today, so despite it being Summer I thought Winter food entirely appropriate. In that spirit I hunted in the freezer, and discovered we had some veal mince. Veal, for those of you not familiar, is young beef - it&amp;rsquo;s tender and sweet, without the heavy beef flavour, much as lamb compares to hogget or mutton.</description>
