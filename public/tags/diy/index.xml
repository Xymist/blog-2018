      <description>While working on the kiosk project I&amp;rsquo;ve been frustrated with the times when our remote terminals are turned off (usually by a user or a cleaner). We can&amp;rsquo;t set them to wake on LAN because we mostly have to go through firewalls and the wider internet, but it would at least be nice to know when and why I can&amp;rsquo;t connect. If nothing else we can then pick up a phone and tell someone to turn it on rather than running a bunch of fruitless network diagnostics.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning for a while to move over from shared hosting to a VPS, partly for control and partly because it seemed like the sort of thing I should know how to do.
Along the way, I managed to:
 Install Nginx (web server, for pointing people to this blog and my main site) Set up Git to allow me to version control and deploy my various sites Acquire an SSL Certificate so that I can force using HTTPS Install and configure Postfix and Dovecot so that my email addresses work.</description>

      <description>Today&amp;rsquo;s new idea, given as a surprise by a friend, is a work satchel, suited to carrying both luncheon and tools. The spec was to be able to carry a lunchbox, a water bottle, and a selection of hand tools, plus snacks and possibly a notepad. It didn&amp;rsquo;t have to carry a laptop, which means smaller pockets and less weight overall.
I generated a five-minute sketch to start with:
Then switched to SketchUp to refine the idea:</description>

      <title>Single-Cylinder Engines (and grease)</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been saying for a while that it would be an excellent idea for me to learn how to clean and maintain internal combustion engines. First because they&amp;rsquo;re interesting, and my knowledge of them has been limited to diagrams1, and second because at some point I&amp;rsquo;d like to own a Series 3 Land Rover or early Defender, which is sort of pointless unless I can maintain it myself.2
Luckily for me, we had a spare IC-powered strimmer in the garage.</description>
